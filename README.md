## 1. Objective

Financial institutions that lend money to consumers usually rely on models to help decide on who to approve or decline for credit (for lending products such as credit cards, automobile loans, or home loans). This project aims to explore and fit a logistic regression model for such goal. 


## 2. Process
Steps that were carried out in the project:

- Explore the data, specifically
- Clean data (handle missing values before fitting models)
- Separate data into test and training sets
- Fit the model
- Produce and interpret confusion matrix
- Plot ROC/AUC curve

## 4. Tools 

The following modules and packages were used in the implementation of this project:

- Python 3
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- statsmodel
- sklearn 

## 5. Programming Report 
The fully-annotated code report can be found in the MLDecidingCreditLoaner.ipynb file in the root directory of the project.
